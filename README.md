# __Predicting Apartment Rental Trends: A Machine Learning Approach__

### __Project 4: Chinna Maijala, Kimberly Her, Yara El-Emam, and Zane Huttinga__

## Description
We analyzed the Apartments for Rent dataset, sourced from the USA classifieds on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our objective is to leverage machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forest, to evaluate model performance and build predictive models that can be applied for future rental price predictions.

## Installation
To run code in Google Colab, start by creating or opening a notebook on the platform. Install any required libraries using __`pip install`__ or __`apt-get install`__. Upload the main csv file manually, "apartments_for_rent_classified_100K.csv". Verify installations by importing libraries and then execute your code. Save your work to Google Drive or download it locally for future use, as Colab sessions reset when closed.

## Roadmap
Although the project is complete, there is always room for improvement. In the future, we may explore optimizing existing features, refining performance, and implementing additional models to enhance the project’s capabilities. While there is no immediate timeline for these updates, we are open to evolving the project and welcome any contributions or suggestions for future enhancements.
