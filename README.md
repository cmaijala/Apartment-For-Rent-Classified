# __Predicting Apartment Rental Trends: A Machine Learning Approach__

### __Project 4: Chinna Maijala, Kimberly Her, Yara El-Emam, and Zane Huttinga__

## Description
We analyzed the Apartments for Rent dataset, sourced from the USA classifieds on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our objective is to leverage machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Forest, to evaluate model performance and build predictive models that can be applied for future rental price predictions.
